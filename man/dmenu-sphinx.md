# NAME

dmenu-sphinx - dmenu-frontend for retrieving and inserting passwords from sphinx(1) into X11 applications

# SYNOPSIS

```
type-pwd username hostname
```

# DESCRIPTION

This tool builds on `type-pwd(1)`, it uses `dmenu(1)` in order to
query a hostname, then depending if only one or more usernames are
known by the oracle - if only one then the next step is skipped:
provides a choice which username to use. Then `type-pwd(1)` is invoked
using the selected user and hostname.

This tool cashes the hostnames it was used with in the file
`~/.sphinx-hosts`.
